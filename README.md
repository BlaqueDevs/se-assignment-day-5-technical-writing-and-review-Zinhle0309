## 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
Understanding your audience’s expertise level helps you adjust how you explain technical information. For tech experts, you can use jargon and dive into deeper details, assuming they know the basics. For regular folks, you need to simplify terms, use analogies, and avoid complicated concepts, making it easy for them to understand. Tailoring your language ensures the message is clear and engaging for everyone.
